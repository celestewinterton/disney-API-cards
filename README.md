<h1 align="center">Disney Character Explorer</h1>

A simple application that takes data from the [Disney API](https://disneyapi.dev/) and displays character cards with information on what films, shows, games, or attractions they were featured in. The user also has the ability to search/filter cards by character name or sort by popularity (popularity is assumed by number of featured items).
